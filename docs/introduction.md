# Introduction

"Allometry" is the study of how organismal size and physiological rates change in relation to body parts (Huxley 1932). The term "allometric" translates from Latin as "different measure," while "isometric" means "equal measure" (Huxley and Tessier 1936). Importantly, natural phenomena, including hierarchical branching networks, are "fractal-like" over a limited range, unlike true fractals, which repeat infinitely. However, our review of the most widely cited research on allometric scaling and fractals finds that vascular organisms and forests are almost exclusively referred to as being "self-similar," and, critically, they were measured using self-similar fractal dimension techniques (Table 1).

For a phenomenon to be self-similar, it must have the same appearance at all scales. This is clearly not the case for organisms, as allometric theory describes changes in appearance as they grow and age (Huxley 1932, Kleiber 1932). This misuse of terminology appears to have started as an oversight by authors incorporating fractals into allometric scaling theory, affecting how ecologists think about scaling processes in relation to fractals. In other cases, the misuse of "self-similar" has limited consequences. For example, predictions from Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST) (West et al. 1999a, West et al. 1999b, Brown et al. 2002) remain unaffected since allometric equations complement self-affinity. Acknowledging self-affinity may reconcile inconsistencies between MST and observed asymmetry in branching architectures (Bentley et al. 2013, Smith et al. 2014).

### Differentiating Between Self-Similarity and Self-Affinity

Reported fractal dimensions of trees and forests using self-similar dimensional analysis are likely to be incorrect based on these facts. Specifically, papers that report the length dimension [Hausdorff-Besicovitch] or box-counting dimension [Minkowski-Bouligand] of hierarchical branching phenomena (leaves, branches, forests) (Table 1) are problematic. Mandelbrot (1985) explained how evaluating fractals using self-similar techniques yields inaccurate results for measuring self-affine fractals because self-affine processes change their dimension between local and global scales. Since vascular plants have self-affine geometries, measuring them with self-similar fractal dimensions is likely to produce spurious values, as demonstrated in this study.

The basic fractal concept requires an object to exhibit a self-similar signal or shape, which can be measured as:

\[
N \propto \frac{1}{\varepsilon^{\beta}} \equiv \varepsilon^{-\beta}
\]

Equation 1

where \(N\) is the number of scalars \( \varepsilon \) required to measure the whole object, and \( \beta \) is a scaling exponent. Mandelbrot (1983, 1985) showed that all \( 1/f^{\beta} \) "noises" are self-affine, and \( \beta \) can be transformatively related to a fractal dimension \( \alpha \) via the Hurst exponent \( H \), such that \( \beta = 2\alpha - H \). Examples of \( 1/f^{\beta} \) noises include white noise (\( 1/f^0 \)) and Brownian noise (\( 1/f^2 \)).

A fractal object's topological dimension is given by \( \beta = \frac{\log N}{\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon}} \). A Euclidean object has a dimension \( \beta \) equal to an integer (Mandelbrot 1983). For example, if \( \beta = 2 \), the object is a square (\( \varepsilon^2 \)), or a disk where \( \varepsilon \) equals \( \pi \times \text{radius} \), and the object's mass \( m \) is equivalent to:

\[
m(\varepsilon) \propto \varepsilon^2
\]

When a portion of the object is removed, its new surface or mass is reduced by the factor \( \delta^{\beta} \), written as:

\[
m(\delta \varepsilon) = \delta^{\beta} m(\varepsilon)
\]
