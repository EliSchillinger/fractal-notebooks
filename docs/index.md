## Self-affinity vs Self-similarity

Much of the scientific literature describing fractal-like hierarchical branching networks of vascular organisms describe them as self-similar. Here we clarify that many such networks are actually self-affine. Self-similarity is an appropriate term for isometry, where objects scale identically in one or more dimensions, while self-affinity describes allometry, or differential scaling in one or more dimensions. Vascular networks in higher organisms facilitate turbulent and laminar mass transport, either by capillary action (in autotrophs) or pulsatile flow (in heterotrophs). Laminar and turbulent motion give way to diffusion as the most efficient mechanism for exchange at small scales, terminating vascularity at approximately 200 nm.

As an example of self-affine versus self-similar fractal dimensions, we calculated the mass dimension \(d_m\) by differential box counting in both synthetic fractal-like forms resembling plants and real vascular plants using x-ray and visible light photographs of the leaves, branches, and roots of individual organisms. We also calculated the mass dimension of forest-scale tree canopies from remote sensing. For leaves, branches, and roots, \(d_m\) was in good agreement with the predictions of Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST), where \(d_m\) is predicted to equal \( \frac{3}{2} \). At the forest level, canopy height models show that \(d_m\) is related to a zeta function \( \zeta^{-s} \), where fractal objects fill available space until they begin to self-thin in relation to their energetic equivalence with locally available free energy.

Our results demonstrate:

1. Dimensional analysis with appropriate self-affine mass dimension shows that many reported fractal dimensions in ecology are either incorrect or inappropriately reported.
2. A technique for testable predictions, including a mechanistic explanation for how individual branching networks grow and fill space and how communities of organisms emerge with fractal dimensions based on MST predictions.

These results may help reveal when communities of individuals have maximized their potential to cycle energy through an ecosystem or when they have been disturbed by exogenous forces.
