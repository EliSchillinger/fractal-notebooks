# Abstract

Much of the scientific literature describes the fractal-like hierarchical branching networks of vascular organisms as 'self-similar'. Here we identify papers where this is incorrectly noted, and provide corrections. We also propose why the branching networks of higher organisms resemble 'self-affine' rather than self-similar  fractals, and provide a theory for predicting fractal dimension in all life forms. Further, we provide an empirical explanation for the fractal-like structures of autotrophic organisms, including primitive algae, lichens, bryophytes, and higher order terrestrial plants. We also briefly describe how self-affinity relates to heterotrophs metabolic demands and circulatory networks.

Self-similarity is an appropriate term for isometry, where objects scale identically in one or more dimensions, while self-affinity describes allometry, or differential scaling in one or more dimensions. 

The vascular networks of most higher organisms facilitate mass transport as capillary action (in autotrophs) or laminar or pulsatile flow (in heterotrophs) and laminar flow with turbulent motion giving way to diffusion at smaller scale (<200nm). Diffusion is the most efficient mechanism for gas exchange at <200nm, eliminating the need for vascularity.

As an example of self-affine versus self-similar fractal dimensions, we calculated the mass dimension \(d_m\) by differential box counting in both synthetic fractal-like forms resembling plants and real vascular plants using x-ray and visible light photographs of the leaves, branches, and roots of individual organisms. We also calculated the mass dimension of forest-scale tree canopies from remote sensing. 

For leaves, branches, and roots, \(d_m\) was in good agreement with the predictions of Metabolic Scaling Theory (MST), where \(d_m\) is predicted to equal \( \frac{3}{2} \). At the forest level, canopy height models show that \(d_m\) is related to a zeta function \( \zeta^{-s} \), where fractal objects fill available space until they begin to self-thin in relation to their energetic equivalence with locally available free energy.

Our results demonstrate:

1. Dimensional analysis with appropriate self-affine mass dimension shows that many reported fractal dimensions in ecology are either incorrect or inappropriately reported.

2. A technique for testable predictions, including a mechanistic explanation for how individual branching networks grow and fill space and how communities of organisms emerge with fractal dimensions based on MST predictions.

These results may help reveal when communities of individuals have maximized their potential to cycle energy through an ecosystem or when they have been disturbed by exogenous forces.

## 1D, 2D, 3D, and 4D fractal-like patterns

We provide a set of example [Jupyter Notebooks]() demonstrating dimensionality of fractal-like behavior in nature.

# Applications

We provide some example applications written in Python which simulate and generate fractal like structures, calculate fractal dimension, and run as stand-alone programs.

# Jupyter Notebooks

For all of our equations and figures in the paper, we provide example notebooks which use publicly available data.
